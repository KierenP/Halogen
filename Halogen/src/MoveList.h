// Assumption: We want to use MoveList objects in a LIFO fashion, always throwing away
// the one that was most recently allocated. Because the search algorithm is recursive, 
// this is a reasonable assumption.

// Assumption: We won't ever call Get() to get more than MAX_DEPTH * 2 'MoveList's. This is 
// justified as Get() is only called on each recursion of NegaScout or Quiessence and we
// should never have more than MAX_DEPTH * 2 recursions. We double MAX_DEPTH because 
// the assumption is not a strong one and in cases like a null move verification search, we 
// may recurse without incrementing distanceFromRoot allowing more than MAX_DEPTH recursions

// MoveListStack acts as an object pool of MoveList objects. It is ~300KB in size. It is
// reasonable to assume this will allow the use of enough MoveList objects simultaneously
// without running out of space.

// Get() returns a MoveListPtr (unique_ptr). When the unique_ptr is destroyed, it signals
// the MoveListPool that this MoveList can now be resused automatically. Take care to manage
// ownership of the unique_ptr to last as long as you need to use the MoveList and no longer.
